C++ Programming

Hello everyone, I’m Tejasvi. I am currently pursuing Computer Programming and Analysis at Seneca Polytechnic.  
This repository contains my assignments and practice work completed while learning the fundamentals of C++ programming.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate core programming concepts, logical problem-solving, and structured coding practices. I hope the code examples here are helpful for learning and understanding C++ basics.

Thank you, and happy learning!
